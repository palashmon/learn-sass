# Learn [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)

This repo is a simple playground to learn and practice more about SASS.

Sass is a stylesheet language thatâ€™s compiled to CSS. It allows you to use variables, nested rules, mixins, functions, and more, all with a fully CSS-compatible syntax. Sass helps keep large stylesheets well-organized and makes it easy to share design within and across projects.
